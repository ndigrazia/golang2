Creating a go.mod File
----------------------
In order to do this we must create a go.mod file. Otherwise, you will see an error thrown:

go: go.mod file not found in current directory or any parent directory; see 'go help modules'

Inside the cards project directory run the following:

go mod init cards

Then, you will be able to use the run test function from within VSCode, and/or run go test from the terminal.




Errorf call has arguments but no formatting directives
----------------------
In the upcoming lecture, we will be running some tests using Errorf. Omitting a formatting directive will now cause the tests to fail, so, we will need to add these right away.

Note - this directive was originally added at the end of the lecture.

When running your tests starting around the 8:00 timestamp, change the following:

t.Errorf("Expected deck length of 16, but got", len(d))

to this:

t.Errorf("Expected deck length of 16, but got %v", len(d))
